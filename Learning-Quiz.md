# Question 1 of 6

Q: You are managing a GitHub repository for a podcast and want to automate the process of generating and deploying new podcast episodes. What is the most efficient way to ensure that new episodes are added to the feed and deployed to the website?

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Create a GitHub action that triggers on a push to the main branch to generate the podcast feed and deploy it.

Correct

Creating a GitHub action that triggers on a push to the main branch automates the process, ensuring consistency and reducing the potential for human error.

</span>

>Use GitHub's Web UI to manually edit the feed file and deploy each new episode.

>Manually run a local script each time you add a new episode and then push the changes to the main branch.

>Create a cron job on your local machine to periodically check for updates and push the new episodes to the main branch.


# Question 2 of 6

Q: You've just finished developing a new GitHub Action for your team. How do you create a release that users can download and use?

>Send an email to your team with the source code attached.

>Directly edit the README file to include the download link.

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Navigate to the repository on GitHub, create a new release with relevant notes and version, and hit Publish release.

Correct
Creating a release on GitHub allows users to download the source code and provides the versioning necessary for them to use the action in their projects.

</span>

>Upload the source code to a file-sharing service and share the link within your project.

# Question 3 of 6

Q: You have finished writing an entrypoint.sh script for a Docker container, which includes git configuration, script execution, and committing changes. Upon running the container, you notice that the script fails at the git commit step with an error stating that no changes were detected. What is the most likely cause of this issue?


>The entrypoint.sh file needs to be executed with a different shell interpreter.

>The Python script executed earlier in the entrypoint.sh file is returning an error.

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) The script did not correctly stage the changes with git add before attempting a commit.

Correct

If the changes are not staged with `git add`, the `git commit` command will not detect any changes to commit, leading to the observed error.

</span>

>The git configuration commands are not correctly setting the username and email.

# Question 4 of 6

Q: You have created a new repository named 'podcast-generator' in GitHub. To ensure that other repositories can use the Python script 'feed.py' from this new repository, which mechanism would you use?

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Create a Dockerfile and an entry point file in the podcast-generator repository.

Correct

Creating a Dockerfile and an entry point file ensures that the feed.py script can be executed within a standardized environment, making it easy for other repositories to call the script as an action.

</span>

>Use Git submodules to link the feed.py script.

>Copy the feed.py script manually into each repository.

>Clone the podcast-generator repository into each new repository.

# Question 5 of 6

Q: You have created a GitHub action to generate podcast feeds but see that the workflow is failing with 'entrypoint.sh: permission denied: unknown' error. Which action should you take to resolve this issue?


>Remove the entrypoint.sh file from the workflow.

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Run the command chmod -R 775 entrypoint.sh to change the permissions of the entrypoint.sh file.

Correct

The chmod -R 775 entrypoint.sh command changes the permissions of the entrypoint.sh file, making it executable and resolving the permission denied error.

</span>

>Modify the GitHub action to exclude the entrypoint.sh file and add it later.

>Revert the workflow file to its previous version.

# Question 6 of 6

Q: You are tasked with setting up a new GitHub Actions workflow in your repository. Part of this action requires pulling data from another repository, processing it using a Docker image you previously built, and then pushing the results back. How would you describe the correct steps to accomplish this using the provided script?

<span style="color: green">

>![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Define an action YAML file that specifies using Docker as the runner, set up the Docker file for processing, and ensure the entry point script handles the workflow execution.

Correct

This approach correctly follows the steps outlined: specifying the action YAML file, using Docker for processing, and ensuring the entry point script can handle the workflow execution.

</span>

>Create separate action workflows for each task (pulling, processing, and pushing) and chain them together.

>Define an action YAML file that directly runs the required commands without using Docker, and ensure the entry point immediately processes the tasks.

>Build a custom GitHub app for handling the execution of workflows and manage it via API calls.
